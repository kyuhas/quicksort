Author: Kaylee Yuhas

Project Description: 
This project takes in user input (in the form of numbers) and creates a doubly 
linked list that stores those values. It terminates when the value '0' is entered. 
After, the linked list is sorted using a quick sort algorithm. 
Finally, the unordered and ordered linked list is printed out for the user to see.
